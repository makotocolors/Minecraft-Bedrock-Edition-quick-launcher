# Minecraft Bedrock Edition quick launcher
A quick and simple launcher for **Minecraft Bedrock Edition** (Click and Run).
This eliminates the need for additional launchers and allows you to easily add it to **Steam** as a non-Steam game. You can then launch it directly from your Steam client, desktop, or any folder where you keep a copy of this project.

Note: This launcher requires an official copy of Minecraft Bedrock Edition installed on your computer.
If it's not installed, a dialog box will appear informing you that Minecraft Bedrock Edition is missing, or you'll be redirected to the Microsoft Store to purchase or install the official launcher.
