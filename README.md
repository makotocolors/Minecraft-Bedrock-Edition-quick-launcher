# Quick Launcher for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition
**A minimalist and practical launcher for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition that lets you start the game with a single click.**

This launcher eliminates the need for additional launchers and simplifies adding Minecraft to Steam as a non-Steam game. Consequently, the game can be launched directly from Steam, the desktop, or any folder containing the launcher.

Without any extra interface or configuration, the launcher runs the official Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and remains active in the background until the game is closed. This makes it well-suited for Steam integration, enabling playtime tracking and live gameplay sharing through the Steam profile.

### Requirements:
* A 64-bit operating system is required.
* An official copy of **Minecraft for Windows** (the **Microsoft Store** version of **Minecraft: Bedrock Edition**) must be installed on the device.

### Support:
